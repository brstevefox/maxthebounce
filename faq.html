    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p><h4>How much does it cost?</h4><br>

A typical day hire rate is &pound;55 - but this could be less - please contact us for  details of discounts on longer hire periods or to discuss your needs<br><br>



<h4>What ages do you cater for?</h4><br>

We accommodate children and youngsters up to and including age 16<br><br>



<h4>I don't have a very big garden - how big are the castles?</h4><br>

Our inflatables are typically 12' X 14' (3.6m X 4.2m) and we need an area of 1m (or 1yd) all the way round to      accommodate safety mats and other equipment<br><br>



<h4>What surface will your castle go onto?</h4><br>

We prefer to pitch on level grass areas although we can often pitch on gentle slopes. We can also pitch on hard surfaces although this may attract a surcharge for the ballast required for anchorage<br><br>



<h4>What sort of access is needed?</h4><br>

A standard width doorway is usually wide enough for us to get through and as long as the site is reasonably  close to the road and there are not too many steps we can get most anywhere<br><br>



<h4>What do I need to provide?</h4><br>

Apart from kids who want to have fun? Nothing! - just an electrical socket not too far away from the site<br><br>



<h4>Can your inflatables be used indoors?</h4><br>

Certainly (provided the ceiling isn't too low!) but probably not the average lounge!  We can normally get into most church/village/school halls - let us know where it is and we'll take a look (and in case they ask you - we are covered up to the required &pound;5m Public Liability Insurance)<br><br>



<h4>What areas do you cover?</h4>

Currently we deliver our castles to the following : Bramhall, Bredbury, Cheadle (and Hulme), Chadkirk, Compstall, Disley, Otterspool, Hazel Grove, Hawk Green, High Lane, Marple, Marple Bridge, Mellor, New Mills,Offerton, Poynton, Romiley, Woodley AND SURROUNDING AREAS
For locations outside these there may be a small delivery surcharge - why not get in touch and we can discuss your needs?</p>
